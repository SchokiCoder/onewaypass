# v0.2.0

- arg `-e` which toggles encryption being used on target or not
- bother with post quantum encryption?

# v0.1.0

+ define goals.md

+ Instead of hardwiring encryption into the application, just call a hash and
  encrypt binary?
  `owp -t ~/.pw -h sha256sum -e "gpg -d" -g facebook.com`

                                     \/
  `owp -t ~/.pw -h sha256sum -e "gpg -c"`
  
  this also sucks:
  `gpg -d my_file | owp -g $(echo "mastadon.social" | sha256sum)`
  
  this straight up doesn't work, pw needs to be piped into owp:
  `gpg -d my_file | owp -a $(echo "mastadon.social" | sha256sum)`

  JUST HARDWIRE the hash and encrypt algorithms!

- What about Username / e-Mail, PIN, Secret Question?
  Just don't care? (Let the user have a seperate file?)

- add arg `-t TARGET_PATH`
- target file specificcation
- add entry add command `owp -a`
- add entry get command `owp -g`
- test removing read bit from target file and then using sudo
- add README.md
- add version print `owp -v`
- add about print `owp --about`
- add manpage
- set version to 0.1.0
