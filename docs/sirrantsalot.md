# Go over Rust?

I have been thinking about Rust's role here...  
Wouldn't Go do?  
It has the same memory safety, or more when unsafe Rust is used.  
Plus it is much simple and more mature, which means better.  
Simpler code is easier to understand and maintain. Security relevant bugs will
likely be spotted earlier. I have read that concurrent Rust _could_ be safer
than concurrent Go... but I don't use concurrency here anyways...  
So why not Go?
