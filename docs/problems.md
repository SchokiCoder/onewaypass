# Usernames

The username problem goes deeper than just saving it or not.  
What about a user having multiple accounts at the same URI?  
Maybe the website saves them like eg. github.com/SchokiCoder.  
But that is not guaranteed. It could be a random string or a number or just not
visible at all.  
In that case the user would need to improvise, which leads to chaos.  
Some may save it as site.com/Username others as site.com_Username.  
Then some may forget how they named their key.  
  
Maybe just incourage the user to always follow the scheme of site.com/Username?  
That would make the username effectively become a password... not quite the goal
of a password manager, right?
